# reposundervolcanos

Building a [leaflet map](http://tuijasonkkila.fi/repos_under_volcanos_map.html) which shows institutional repositories within a 50 km radius from volcanos. Volcano data from [#tidytuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday), repository data via [CORE REST API](https://core.ac.uk/services/api/).

An exercise mainly to become familiar with the *st_distance* and *st_buffer* functions of the [sf](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf) R package.
